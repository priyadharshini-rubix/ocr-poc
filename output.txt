ABSTRACT (2) We implemented a baseline approach to intent classification

In this demo, we introduce the DBPEDIA CHATBOT, a knowledge-
_graph-driven chatbot designed to optimize community interaction.
‘The bot was designed for integration into community software 10
facilitate the answering of recurrent questions. Four main challenges
‘were addressed when building the chatbot, namely (1) understanding
user queries, 2) fetching relevant information based on the queries,
(3) tailoring the responses based on the standards of each output
platform (ie. Web, Slack, Facebook) as well as (4) developing sub-
sequent user interactions with the DBPEDIA CHATROT. With this
demo, we will showcase our solutions to these four challenges.
